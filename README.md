mobservable-react-boilerplate
=====================

A minimal application that combines [Mobservable](https://mweststrate.github.io/mobservable) with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react).
Supports ES6 and JSX compilation through babel.

For a more sophisticated project to start with, see the full TodoMVC implementation: [mobservable-react-todomvc](https://github.com/mweststrate/mobservable-react-todomvc).

The Mobservable dev-tools are disabled by default. Enable them if needed in `src/index.js`.

### Run the example

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```
